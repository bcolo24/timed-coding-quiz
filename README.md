# timed-coding-quiz

## Description

I created this quiz to use as a study tool for bootcamp. I can add more questions as we continue to learn new topics in the course, and it would be a good way to reiterate important concepts. Since we do not get tested on topics in this course, I thought it would be a great way to incorporate that into my learning. I also built it as a way to practice my ability to write code in Javascript, HTML, and CSS. I learned how to write and call functions, how to notify the user after pressing a button, and install a timer and high score system into my site.

## Installation 
N/A

## Usage
To use this application, press start when the screen loads. Following that, the user will read the questions and pick their answer. If they get an answer wrong, it will decrease ten seconds off of the timer. When the quiz is over, their score is equal to the time left on the clock. The user can enter their initials and see where their score falls in the list of users who have played on that device.
